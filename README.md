# LAP-1-Project-RP

The project aim was to design a message board, which will allow users to post anonymously. Users will be able to post emojis, comments and gifs.

The theme of the message board was The Matrix. From the front page, users can decide to pick the 'blue pill' which takes them to regular twitter, and the 'red pill' 
to take them to our message board. The website is styled like the matrix , with a few easter eggs put in as well. See you if you can find them.
